Its been a long time since I have made any posts on this blog. I am very
busy these days and its been very hard to find time. To continue with
the post, I was looking at alternate providers for this site and I ran
into [VistaDB](http://www.vistadb.net/) . Its a fully managed file based
SQL engine. What got me interested is it has a free express edition and
it supports SProcs :) . I will provide the full source for the site once
I develop it. For starters I wanted a provider API for VistaDB with
membership, roles and profile management.Â  Well I got membership and
roles from the forum I guess ( I don't remember ) , and added a profile
provider to it. Its not perfect and you might find a lot of bugs.

You can download the source for it from
[here](/GetFile.ashx?file=VistaDBProviders.zip). It has the full source
code for the providers and a sample website.

Any sort of feedback is appreciated.
