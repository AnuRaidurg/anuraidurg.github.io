As promised in my previous post on [VistaDB
providers](/2008/09/30/VistaDB-Providers/), I
have implemented the VistaDB provider for my website. The full source
code is available
[here](/downloads/MPS_VistaDB.zip).
Note : I did this in a hurry and I might have missed out on some things.
Please feel free to send feed back on this.
