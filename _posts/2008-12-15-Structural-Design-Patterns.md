In the previous few posts I have been writing about design patterns and
for now I have completed the structural patterns as described by the
GOF. Below are the links to all the structural patterns.

1.  [Decorator
    Pattern](/2008/11/17/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Decorator-Pattern/)
2.  [Proxy
    Pattern](/2008/11/24/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Proxy-Pattern/)
3.  [Bridge
    Pattern](/2008/11/27/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Bridge-pattern/)
4.  [Composite
    Pattern](/2008/12/01/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Composite-Pattern/)
5.  [Flyweight
    Pattern](/2008/12/04/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Flyweight-Pattern/)
6.  [Adapter
    Pattern](/2008/12/07/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Adapter-Pattern/)
7.  [Fa√ßade
    Pattern](/2008/12/11/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Facade-Pattern/)

In the following posts to come, I will write about the Creational
Patterns.
