In my last five posts, I have written about the Creational Design
Patterns as described by the GOF. Below are the links for all the
Creational patterns.

1.  [Prototype
    Pattern](/2008/12/15/Design-Patterns-For-Dummies.-The-Prototype-Pattern/)
2.  [Factory Method
    Pattern](/2008/12/18/Design-Patterns-For-Dummies.-The-Factory-Method-Pattern/)
3.  [Singleton
    Pattern](/2008/12/22/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Singleton-Pattern/)
4.  [Abstract Factory
    Pattern](/2009/01/05/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Abstract-Factory-Pattern/)
5.  [Builder
    Pattern](/2009/01/08/Design-Patterns-for-Dummies.-The-Builder-Pattern/)

You can read about Structural Patterns from
[here](/2008/12/15/Structural-Design-Patterns/).

In the following posts to come, I will write about the Behavioral
Patterns.
