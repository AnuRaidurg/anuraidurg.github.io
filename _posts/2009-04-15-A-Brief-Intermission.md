I got a (few) comment by [Colin](http://colinjack.blogspot.com/) on my
previous
[post](http://www.simplyvinay.com/Post/46/DDDBlog-Implementation.-Part-1.aspx)
on the
[series](http://www.simplyvinay.com/Post/42/My-foray-into-DDD,-TDD,-MVC-and-NHibernate.aspx)
that I had started.

He goes like this for me saying that I am the domain expert for the
sample application I was building.

And for the application itself…

Even I had a few doubts about the application when I had planned for it,
so from my next post ( for the series ), I wont be talking about DDD
anymore. So what changes? Nothing really, from the project structure to
the tools, nothing changes. Having a domain layer doesn't mean that the
application uses DDD and segregating the project structure as I have
gives a clear understanding with separation of concerns. Although I
might have have to change a few things that I had thought of using like
the Aggregates and a few. I don’t want that sort of complexity as of
now.

And about DDD, I really like the way it helps you build a software. I
have barely touched the surface of it and will surely blog about it in
the future.

P.S. The sample application will no longer be called as DDDBlog. This
site is running on a custom blog I wrote which I had named MPS (
MyPersonalSite ), so may be I will call the sample application as
MPBlog.
