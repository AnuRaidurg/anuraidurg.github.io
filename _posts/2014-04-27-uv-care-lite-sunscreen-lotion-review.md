Hello Everybody!!!!!
Sweltering heat is here and all of us are out in our best summer wear. But summers also causes sun tan and sun burns. So using sunscreens is a must in summer to avoid damage to our skin. Infact sunscreens should be used throughout the year. I am reviewing one of the best sunscreen lotion this time around as it claims to be the Gen Next lotions. I am always on a constant look out for new skin products, be it sunscreens or moisturizers. Summer is really harsh this time and my skin had become really dark. I came across this sunscreen lotion at a chemist shop called UV CARE LITE the Gen Next lotion SPF 26+ with skin lightening properties. I quickly grabbed it as it claimed to have skin lightening formula because my skin had gone awry this time.

**Here is the snap shot of the list of ingredients:**

After cleansing, I applied the sunscreen liberally all over my face 20 minutes prior to stepping out of the house. I set my look with a loose powder. The sunscreen can also be mixed with make up if you do not wish to use it alone. It says to use twice daily, but I use it only in the mornings as I don’t feel the need to apply in the evening. I have been using this sunscreen for almost a month now and I can see visible changes in my skin already. My tan has reduced to a great extent and my face really glows.

**My take on the UV CARE LITE sunscreen:**

**Pros:**

* Easy to apply. It absolutely slides like silk and gets completely absorbed in the skin.
* Light weight, oil free and Non-greasy. You don’t feel that you have applied something on your face.
* Doesn&#8217;t leave a white cast on the face.
* Quite moisturizing. Though dry skinned beauties may apply their regular moisturizer with this.
* Gives an instant glow and brightens the face.
* Water resistant.
* It did not break me out though my skin is very sensitive.
* Suits all skin types.

**Cons:**

The only biggest con is it contains parabens. Some people may be allergic to parabens. Most of the creams and lotions contain parabens and may or may not cause allergy or break outs. My sensitive skin responded very well and could tolerate to this sunscreen lotion and I can guarantee that it will suit all skin types.

So go grab this unique and amazing sunscreen lotion priced at Rs. 680/- for 60ml from your nearest chemist shop and be sun ready always.
