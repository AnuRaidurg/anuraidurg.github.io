Hello Everbody!!!
Today I would be reviewing Vaseline healthy white with SPF 24 triple lightening lotion. I am never satisfied with sunscreens. Be it lotions, creams or gels. I am never ever satisfied as sunscreen makes ones skin oily, sticky or leaves a white cast which is so unpleasant. Few days ago one of my friend suggested Vaseline healthy white with SPF 24 triple lightening lotion. I am a huge fan of Vaseline products since my college days and I had seen the advertisements about this body lotion which claims to lighten the skin as it contains vitamin B3 and at the same time protects the skin from the harmful rays of sun.

It is suggested that the lotion to be used twice daily for best results and not to stay too long in the sun even while using a product with sunscreen.

**My Take On Vaseline Healthy White SPF 24 Triple Lightening Lotion**

The lotion just glided on my skin like magic. It vanished in few seconds of applying. The lotion is not very thick and absorbs immediately. It is not too moisturizing though so it may not help dry skinned people. It is more of a sunscreen lotion rather than a moisturizer. I tried applying the lotion on my face too and believe me the experiment worked wonders. I suggest oily skinned people to try and apply on the face you all will love it. So I use the lotion everyday on my face and other exposed part of my body after cleansing, topping up with my moisturizer as it does not moisturize that well. My sensitive skin responded well to this lotion. I have been using this lotion since few weeks and I can see visible changes in my skinâ€™s texture and my dark spots seemed to have faded a bit too.
As far as I am aware, the previous version of this product contained parabens and few other ingredients. But the latest version of this product does not contain parabens.

**Pros:**

* Glides and absorbs on the skin like magic.
* Leaves no dirty white cast
* May moisturize well for oily skinned people.
* Non-sticky and non-greasy.
* Gives a subtle sheer glow
* Sensitive skinned people can also try using on face as it      does not contain parabens.
* Contains SPF 24 which gives good protection from the sun.
* Works as a good make up base if applied for face.

**Cons:**

* Does not moisturize well at all especially for dry skinned      people like me applying another layer of moisturizer would be preferable.
* Wary about the skin lightening claim.

**Final verdict:**

I would definitely buy this lotion again for sure as it is affordable. Priced at Rs. 95/- the lotion is easily available throughout the country. So what are you waiting for grab the lotion at your nearest shop and feel the experience for yourself.
