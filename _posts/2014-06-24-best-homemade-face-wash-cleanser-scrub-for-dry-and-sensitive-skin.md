Hellooooooooo!!!
How is everybody doing today?
I have an excellent homemade face wash especially for dry sensitive skin which can be effortlessly prepared at home. I have a very dry and sensitive skin which flakes off and gets irritated easily. I tried using all kinds of mild soaps, cleansers, face washes, scrubs to get rid of dryness and irritation. But to no vain, I did not get a solution for any of those. My mom was suggesting me since a long time to try and use ground split red lentils (masoor dal) on my face instead of those harsh soaps. I was not too keen to use it intially but gave in after sometime. I was thinking ‘Big Deal’ what this lentil powder can do to get rid of my dryness. But believe me after using for the first time my skin felt so soft, smooth and my face was literally glowing (yes you heard it right it gave a really good glow after the first wash itself). I have few open pores on my cheeks and after using this I could see that my pore size had also minimized to a great extent. I could really see a new me.

Homemade Cleanser

I experimented a bit more and mixed dried orange peel or rinds to the lentil powder. I started using this mixture on a daily basis and my dark spots caused by acne faded in just a week. It was like this miracle mixture that I was waiting for since so many years. Mixing dried orange rind powder really helped because orange contains a very high amount of Vitamin C which helps in healing and lightnening the skin. It controls excess oil too which is of great help to oily skinned people. It is also a natural bleach. You can also try mixing dried lemon peel or rind powder to the mixture. But I would suggest to add orange powder rather than lemon because its less irritating on the skin. Many people cannot tolerate lemon juice on their skin because its highly acidic in nature. You can also try mixing dried rose petals or rose water to the mixture and use the same. The mixture can be used in face packs also. The mixture can be used as a scrub if grounded coarsely.

Say Bye!!! To soaps, cleansers, face wash and scrubs when you have this miracle mixture which is so economical and can be prepared right at home without any fuss.
