Hiiiiiiiiiiiii Hellooooooooooooo!!!!
I am here to tell all how to prepare simple homemade foundation that is not only easy to prepare but also very natural. As in no harsh chemicals are used to make this foundation.
So here we goâ€¦

Ingredients Required:

* Arrowroot powder or cornstarch
* Cocoa powder
* Cinnamon Powder

You can find all the ingredients easily available in any super market or grocery store. It is not expensive either.

The first ingredient that is arrowroot would be white powdery in color that would make the base for our foundation. Arrowroot is basically a starch derived from the plant called rhizomes (rootstock). It will be like cornstarch. So even cornstarch can be used instead of arrowroot. But I prefer using arrowroot over cornstarch as it has amazing healing benefits and quite mild on the skin too. It is not harsh and will not cause any reaction or rash when applied over the skin. The name arrowroot was given because in ancient times it was used to treat the injured people with wounds who were hit by poisoned arrows. Both arrowroot and cornstarch are used in many cosmetic products and also in cooking as thickening agents.

The second ingredient is cocoa powder which everybody knows is the substance derived from the cocoa beans. It is the remaining substance derived from the cocoa butter which is extracted from the cocoa beans. Cocoa powder is rich in flavonoids, antioxidants and many minerals which are great for the skin. The natural cocoa powder would be light brown in color whereas the processed ones would be much darker. Try to go for the organic cocoa powder if possible. Even cocoa is used in cooking and other products.

The third and the last ingredient is cinnamon which is a spice derived from the inner bark of several trees and is used in many recipes also. Cinnamon again is rich in antioxidants and minerals which soothe the skin and helps eliminate acne and pimples. If you want to prepare cinnamon powder at home try to get thin cinnamon sticks which will be light brown in color rather than thick ones which will give a much darker shade.

**How To Prepare Homemade Foundation:**

Fine there is no particular measurement as such to prepare the foundation. I simply started mixing both cocoa and cinnamon powder to the arrowroot powder till I got my right shade. My skin is on the paler side so I had to mix a very tiny amount of both cocoa and cinnamon powder to get my shade and Voila!!! I succeeded.

Natural Homemade Foundation

I suggest using a very less amount of cinnamon over cocoa powder because few people may be allergic to cinnamon. The latter can be used generously.  I have a very sensitive and dry skin so I used cocoa more. Extra use of cinnamon can give a yellowish or orangey look on the paler skin. Little foundation is required for the face to get a flawless and glowing skin.
If you have dry skin simply combine the powder with any essential oils (see my earlier post) like jojoba, argan, almond or olive oils and can be used as a liquid foundation.
Hope everybody has learnt to prepare a hassle free and inexpensive homemade foundation??? Try it for yourself!!!!!
