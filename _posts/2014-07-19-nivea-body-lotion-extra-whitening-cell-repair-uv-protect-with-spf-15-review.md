Whatâ€™s up people!!!!
Hope everybody is doing good?
I am here with yet another review of a body lotion from Nivea.
I have developed a fetish lately of using body lotions on face. I had tried Vaseline healthy white body lotion and was pretty satisfied with it. While I was out grocery shopping my eyes fell on Nivea Body Lotion Extra Whitening Cell Repair &amp; UV Protect with SPF 15. (Gosh!! Was quite impressed with the name itself).

Thought of giving this a try because I was blown away with the ingredients which claimed to help repair the years of dullness and damage on the skin and protect it from sun effectively without leaving harmful residues. The main ingredient being camu camu and acerola cherry which claims to have 50 times higher vitamin C content compared to other vitamin C rich fruits. One good thing about this lotion is it is free of Paraben, Mineral Oil, Colorants and Bleaching agents which many people with sensitive skin cannot tolerate. It claims to repair dark spots, tanning, uneven skin tone and rough skin and the visible effects can be seen in just 14 days.

**My View On Nivea Body Lotion Extra Whitening Cell Repair &amp; UV Protect with SPF 15:**

I have been using this lotion on my face and body for almost 20 days now and regrettably the body lotion had my thumbs down. It failed to get any points as it does not moisturize my dry skin at all. I need to use a separate moisturizer in combination with this lotion to get rid of my dryness. After using this lotion I tanned miserably and my skin got even worse. I looked one shade darker than usual. The packaging is horrible. The bottle comes in a flip top and has a wide mouth where the lotion spills out easily causing more wastage and looks clumsy. Clever me bought the smallest bottle of the lotion to try out first. Luckily I did not go for the bigger bottle.

**Pros:**

It is free of Paraben, Mineral Oil, Colorants and harmful Bleaching agents.
It may moisturize well for normal skinned people.
Has SPF 15 which is decent enough for regular usage.

**Cons:**

Does not moisturize enough for dry skinned people.
Whitening claim is all a sham.
Contains silicones (People who are sensitive to silicones may skip using it on the face).
Contains loads of acids which may burn sensitive skin (Like mine).

**Final Verdict:**

I will not buy this lotion again because it did not benefit my skin in any way. The smallest bottle that is 50 ml costs Rs. 118/-. The lotion is available in any local store throughout the country.
