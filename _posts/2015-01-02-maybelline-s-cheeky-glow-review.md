Hello all you beautiful people!!!!
Happy New Year and hope everybody is at the pink of their health.
The color pink reminds me of the subtle and soft shade that most people like, especially by girls. By now you must be thinking which product I would be reviewing today. Yes I am going to review on the Cheeky Glow blush by Maybelline. It comes in 3 shades – Fresh Coral, Peachy Sweetie and Creamy Cinnamon.

Peachy sweetie is more of pink in color rather than peach and Creamy cinnamon is ofcourse a brown shade which will suit darker or may be wheatish skinned people also.
I picked up Fresh coral as it came close to my skin tone and suited me very well.

Maybelline&#8217;s Cheeky Glow Blush

Had never used a blush in my life before but after using this product am in awe and cannot keep raving about it. Blush can be applied in many ways. Usually the blush is applied on the apple of the cheeks but that would look good who have high cheek bones which will give a nice contouring. I am a no makeup person and usually keep my skin care regime as simple as possible. I tried this blush on my bare skin sans makeup and it looked very natural on my face. What I liked about this blush is it has just the right amount of pigmentation which does not go over board when applied. The texture is very smooth and creamy and blends very easily. I have a very dry skin and I was little skeptical to use it on my bare skin for the first time. But I was really surprised when the blush did not cause any flakiness or dryness. Infact it gave a nice glow to my face and stayed on for almost 6hrs. Most of the blushes contain Mica and titanium dioxide which gives a luminosity to the face. The main pro of this product is it is non-comedogenic, so the skin can breathe easily without clogging pores. Though the quantity is decent enough (7gms) and priced at Rs. 250/- it surely lasts for a very long time.
I would definitely keep buying blushes from now. Soooooo go girls and Blushhhhhhhh on!!!!!!!!!
