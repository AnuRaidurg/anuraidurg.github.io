Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :smile:
Today I would be making a yummy review that you all going to love it!!!
Yes you heard it right, yummy review that you will feel like eating it.
As you all know that I have a very dry skin and I am not able to use or apply any cleanser or face wash, apart from my homemade scrub. I happened go to this organic shop where I found this awesome and yummy soap bar called Bite Me Chocolate from Soulflower.

Though I bought the soap spontaneously as the bar was meant for dry skin, I wanted to do a little research on the product myself.
Ok so here we go!!! The brand Soulflower offers a variety of 100% organic and handmade products which are made purely from natural ingredients.

Soulflower&#8217;s Bite Me Chocolate Soap

About the product:

Some people say there are some things that chocolate can&#8217;t do, but this yummy mouthwatering soap begs to differ. This moisturizer cum soap will coat your skin with soft luscious butters, helping to prevent skin from drying out &amp; cell renewal &amp; rejuvenating properties of chocolate keep your skin supple &amp; radiant.
Take this chocolate bar into the shower everyday with you; enjoy its rich, creamy lather to get super soft skin. Suitable for dry, broken sensitive skin.

**Contains :** Real dark chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, Vitamin E, glycerin, milk, aqua, olive, rice bran, coconut, castor &amp; palm oil.
Real dark chocolate is made from raw cocoa, which has the maximum amount of antioxidants &amp; flavonoids making it an excellent moisturizer that leaves your skin soft &amp; glowing.
Cocoa powder imparts a wonderful aroma &amp; is a powerful antioxidant which protects &amp; frees the skin from free radicals that causes significant damage to skin layers.
Cocoa butter is obtained from the same bean as chocolate &amp; is made up of small particles that penetrate even the smallest of pores; giving it high moisturizing qualities that help protect &amp; soften skin. Imparts a rich &amp; creamy lather to the soap.

**WHAT IS 100% VEG ORGANIC SOAP?**

Soulflower soap is made with vegetable oils of olive, rice bran, castor, coconut &amp; palm oil. During the natural saponification of these oils, soap is produced. Glycerin is a natural byproduct of the soap making &amp; has humectant properties, attracting moisture to your skin making it softer &amp; smoother, one of the reasons that the soaps are so beautiful on the skin.

**My Take On the Soulflower – Bite Me Chocolate Soap**

When I first used the soap on my face I felt the yummy chocolaty smell lingering all over my face. The soap is so creamy and bubbly that you don’t feel like taking off the lather from your face (smile). The best part is it did not dry my face at all. My face looked glowy, supple and well moisturized. Soulflower soap comes in large bar sizes, so you can cut how much you need, and store the unused soap in a cool dry place for a longer shelf life. Keep the soap in a soap dish, so that water drains away &amp; the soap is dry when not in use. Does not contain artificial hardeners &amp; preservatives. The price is Rs. 200/- for 150 gms which I feel is decent enough considering the bar size which lasts for a really long time if used properly. Can be bought online or in any organic shops. I could not find a con as I really liked the soap. I would definitely buy this soap again.
So as far as my skin loves chocolate it’ll keep biting my face :wink:
