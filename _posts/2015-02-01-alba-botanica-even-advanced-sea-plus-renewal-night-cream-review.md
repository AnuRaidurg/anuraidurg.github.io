Hello lovely people!!!!

I hope everybody is doing great :smile:
I think every girl should start applying night cream and make it the essential part of their skin care regime once they hit the age of 25 so as to overcome the early signs of ageing. I am very particular about my skin care products as my skin is very sensitive and dry. When I wanted to buy a night cream I was confused because I saw night creams with loads of chemicals in it which scared me even further. Luckily my friend suggested me to try Alba Botanica Even Advanced Sea Plus Renewal Night Cream which has 100% vegetarian ingredients as in it has not been tested on animals, no artificial colors, no parabens, no phthalates and no sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate or sodium myreth sulfate.

Alba Botanica Even Advanced Night Cream

When I bought the night cream I was surprised to see a huge list of ingredients, but thankfully it was all natural ingredients which suited my skin to the core. 

**Take a look at the ingredients:**

Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Anacyclus Pyrethrum Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract(1), Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract(1), Cucumuis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Enteromorpha Compressa Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract, Ulva Lactuca Extract(1), Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Allantoin, Ascorbic Acid, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Citric Acid, Diacetyl Boldine, DMAE Bitarate, Erythritol, Homarine HCL, Polysorbate 60, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Sorbitol, Squalane, Thioctic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol(1), Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzyl Benzoate, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Fragrance (Parfum).

**What does the product has to say:**

The preferred choice in the evening wear
While you catch your z-z-z&#8217;s, this little gem works the night shift to help break up uneven pigmentation and dull spots for a bright morning complexion. When used nightly, the botanically powerful Marine Complex, enriched with DMAE, fortifies skin and reduces discoloration after 2 weeks* (*Based on clinical results) while it plumps skin with continuous moisture. Potent antioxidant-packed Thioctic Acid helps minimize the effects of sun, stress and time. It is also hypo-allergenic. Sleep on it for more clarity in the morning.

**Directions to Use:**

Apply to face and neck after cleansing and before bed
My Take On Alba Botanica Even Advanced Sea Plus Renewal Night Cream:
I was a bit reluctant to use the night cream as my skin became very dry after using for few days. But somehow I continued to use it continuously after giving a gap of day or two. After a week my skin got accustomed to the product and I could feel the changes in my skin. Dry patches gone, no redness and my skin felt really soft and smooth once I woke up in the morning. The texture of the cream is quite creamy but once you put on the face it just vanishes into the skin. It felt light, non-greasy and completely gets absorbed into the skin. Probably the only Con I can think of is it did not fade my acne marks even after using for good one month. Otherwise it is a very good night cream which moisturizes the skin well. Can be used by oily skinned people too. I may not rebuy it because for the quantity of 57 gms it costs Rs. 1175/- which is on the higher side.  Where in you can get much cheaper night creams in other brands which does the same job.
Do give it a try if you are a fan of botanical extract or all natural ingredient creams.
