Hey People!!!!Today I would be reviewing an outstanding product from Fem (Dabur India) called Aloederm. Aloe is said to be a wonder product for many problems. Be it cuts, wounds, burns, acne, stretch marks or even stomach ailments aloe is the one stop solution. I have been experimenting a lot lately with med store or therapeutic products. I always apply moisturizer as part of my beauty regime and bought this cream because it contained the goodness of aloe.

Aloederm Skin Cream

**Ingredients:**

Aloevera juice, Propylene glycol, Cetostearyl alcohol, Isopropyl myristate, Emulsifying wax, Sesame Oil, Niacinamide, Liquid paraffin, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Glyceryl stearate, Laureth-23, Lanolin, Perfume, Vitamin E acetate, Disodium EDTA, Butylated hydroxy toluene.
The key ingredients as per the product are Aloevera, Sesame oil, Niacinamide and Vitamin E.
Aloe is an excellent moisturizer and wound healer. It keeps the skin soft, smooth and supple. It builds up collagen and elastin and increases firmness of the skin.
Sesame oil is rich source of omega fatty acids. It ensures proper penetration of the active ingredients. It also nourishes the skin and retains moisture.
Niacinamide is an important vitamin that reduces skin blotchiness, fine lines and wrinkles. It also improves skin elasticity.
Vitamin E plays an important role in preventing oxidative damage and maintains skin integrity.

**My Take On Aloederm Skin Cream:**

I use this cream in the night as I feel it’s a bit heavy to use it in the mornings. I always wake up with soft, supple, smooth and a glowing face. I felt my skin is healthy and firm. I could actually see my acne marks getting lightened with continued use. My dilated pores were hardly visible. It did not break me out, infact I can say it is a very good cream for acne prone skin. Dry skinned people can safely try applying in the mornings too in combination with other creams. I am happy that it does not contain parabens or silicones. The best part is this cream is for all skin types and it’s a multi-purpose cream. Probably the only con I could think of right now is it may not spread well if you have very dry skin.
The product is economically priced at Rs. 110/- for 50gms and goes a long way if used sparingly. Try it once and feel the difference!!!
