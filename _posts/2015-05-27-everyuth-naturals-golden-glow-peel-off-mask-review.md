Hello!!!!!!!!
Wedding season is back and everybody wants to look their best. My friends wedding was round the corner and all my friends were prepping up for the same. I am not a big fan of salon facials but even I would definitely want to look my best during occasions. I had heard lots about Everyuth naturals golden glow peel-off mask and thought of giving it a try for a quick fix facial (Lazy me :-))

Everyuth Naturals Golden Glow Peel-Off Mask

**What does the product claim: New Advanced Formula**

Dust, dirt and pollution clog skin pores and make the skin look dull and dark. New advanced everyuth naturals Golden Glow Peel-off Mask is a home facial with Nano Gold Peptide and Minerals that works wonders on the skin. It peels away dead cells, dirt and bacteria from within the skin pores, stimulates blood circulation and oxygen supply. In just 15 minutes, it gives an instant fairness with a golden glow.
Suitable for all skin types (may vary depending on weather conditions and skin type)

**Directions for use:**

Wash your face, pat skin dry. Apply even layer over your face avoiding delicate areas like eyes and mouth. Do not apply a very thin layer as it will not peel off evenly. Let it dry for 15 minutes. Peel off from forehead in a downward direction towards chin. Wash off if required. Use at least twice a week to get the best results.

**Ingredients:**

Water, Alcohol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Polyethylene Glycol 1500, Propylene Glycol, Orange Peel Extract, Methyl Paraben, Fragrance, C.l. NO.77019, C.l. NO. 77891, C.l. NO. 77491, C.l. NO. 77861, Gellan Gel, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Silica, Tin Oxide, Acetyl Heptapeptideâ€“9 and colloidal Gold, Phenoxyethanol, Color Sunset Yellow C.l. NO. 15985, Lactic Acid.

**My Take On Everyuth Naturals Golden Glow Peel-Off Mask:**

I followed the instructions and applied an even layer of the mask on my face. The mask has golden glitter particles (colloidal gold) and has a typical everyuth natural orangy fruity smell. The consistency is medium and can be spread easily. It took a little more than 15 minutes for the mask to dry completely. After I peeled off my mask, I noticed a radiant golden glow on my face. My skin felt soft and smooth but a little stretchy as I have dry skin, so I followed it by applying a moisturizer. The product has the goodness of orange peel extract, peptides, colloidal gold and lactic acid which works deep into the skin to remove dead cells to give a nice radiant golden glow which lasts for hours (15 hours for me to be precise). The only complaint which I have is that it contains parabens. Other than this I am completely in love with this mask. Before any occasion or an event I make sure to apply this mask for a more radiant me. I bought a 30 gms tube for Rs. 50/- and I feel it is worth the money as it lasts for a really long time.
People who do not wish to have an elaborate salon facial like me :smile: can opt for this quick fix facial at home anytime and keep GLOWING!!!!!!!!
