Heya Amino!!!!!

Surprised????  I am no talking mandarin here :wink: instead I am about to review a product from Meiji India who are popular for their Amino Collagen supplement.

Let me tell you a brief about Amino Collagen:

<!--more-->
Collagen is the most ample natural protein which is made up of amino acids found in the human body which holds the whole body together. It is found in the bones, muscles, skin and tendons. Collagen contains specific amino acids like Glycine, Proline, Hydroxyproline and Arginine. Collagen makes up approximately 30% of the proteins within the body. Skin is the largest organ of the human body and has to undergo lot of transformation due to aging, sun exposure, pollution and stress. During this course the skin tends to lose its natural texture and sheen and likely to decline in collagen. Luckily the lost collagen can be replaced by taking the right supplements. There are two types of collagen, Type I and Type II collagens which benefits skin, hair and nails and the other for bones and tendons respectively.

**A little about the company:**

Meiji is Japan’s leading MNC and FMCG giant which deals in Pharmaceutical, Confectionary, Beauty &amp; Wellness and is one of the largest manufacturers of low – molecular weight natural collagen peptides. It is Japan’s leading beauty supplement for last 7 years. Whereas Meiji India handles Indian sub-continent.

**My Take On Meiji Amino Collagen Skin Glow:**

I received a generous sample from the Meiji India company and started religiously taking the supplement from the day I got the product with a glass of lemon juice in the night. I made sure to take the supplement everyday, but sometimes I had to miss (blame my busy schedule :-(). So after a month long consumption of the supplement, here I am with the review. I am blessed with a decent good skin but my main concern was under eye dark circles, dry skin and thin hair.

**Pros:**

I could not see any changes in my skin for the first one week but after 20 days of consumption I could really notice that my under eye dark circles have drastically reduced. My skin felt firm, smooth, supple and well moisturized. No signs of dryness :smile: my skin was glowing from within. My hair was bouncier and glossy. May be if I had taken without a miss I could have seen the results faster. But I feel it will take a minimum of 8-12 weeks to really see the dramatic results.

**Cons:**

Major con would be the taste and the smell. It does state to be odorless and tasteless but it has a lingering fishy taste and smell to it which lasts for quite sometime. There was a decrease in appetite which may be a pro or a con depending upon a particular situation or an individual. Some people may be allergic to collagen supplements( read allergic to sea food) and that hardly accounts for 1% of users as per reports.
Priced at Rs. 1800/- for 200 gms, it is definitely on the higher side and I am little skeptical about the affordability. Otherwise the product is excellent and people can reap the benefits from the same as long as they consume it. It is available online and delivers the product to almost all the major cities in India.
So rave Amino Collagen for a healthy looking you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
