Hello People!! What’s up??
Hope New year brings you all happiness and good health. Everybody must know that sunscreens are essential throughout the year as the sun’s harmful rays can penetrate through the delicate skin and cause damage even on cloudy and chilly days. I am always on a look out for good and safe products for my sensitive and dry skin. I came across this good sunscreen for oily skin called Suncros Aqua Gel from Ranbaxy Laboratories which I have been using since couple of months.

Suncros AquaGel Sunscreen

**What does the product offer**

Suncros Aqua Gel SPF 26 is Non-greasy, water resistant sunscreen specially suited for oily skin, humid conditions and excessive sweating. Contains Nano-sized Zinc Oxide for complete UV-A and UV-B protection. Superior UV-A protection compared to ordinary sunscreens.

**Composition**

Octinoxate USP-7.5%, Avobenzone USP-2%, Oxybenzone USP-3%, Processed Zinc Oxide (nanosized) equivalent to Zinc Oxide-2%, Phenoxyethanol IP (preservative)-0.5%

**My Take On Suncros Aqua Gel**

Though I have a very sensitive and dry skin, I went ahead to use this specially formulated gel for oily skinned people as the word Nano-size caught my sight. Ok here we go….day one upon using the gel, My forehead started burning, stung badly and broke me out. I was persistent on using it because I thought the gel would get adjusted to my skin. But somehow my skin reacted very badly to the gel. My face was like a war zone. Acne all over my face. I immediately stopped using it and within few days my acne started disappearing (Lucky me). May be chemical sunscreens doesn’t suit my sensitive skin. But I must say when I was using this gel it gave me complete protection from the sun. No sun burn or tan whatsoever. My skin used to glow whenever I used to apply this sunscreen.

**Pros**

Good SPF of 26 which is ideal for Indian climate.
Gives a nice glow to the skin when applied.
Little goes a long way (still on the first tub since couple of months).
Doesn’t leave a ghostly white cast.
Dry skinned people can also apply this gel using a moisturizer beneath.
It is indeed gel based and water resistant as I had to wash several times to get over the gel off my face.

**Cons**

It is definitely not non-comedogenic as it is nowhere mentioned on the carton or the tub. So I don’t think it is suitable for oily acne prone sensitive skinned people.
It is little difficult to spread the gel and it takes a while to absorb into the skin.
The skin may look shiny if not properly rubbed onto the face. Loose powder may be applied to get rid of the shiny look.
My Final Verdict:
I would definitely not buy this sunscreen again and would look for better sunscreens which will suit me. It is priced at Rs.345/- and is easily available in all med stores. So people try this new generation sunscreen gel if it suits and be sun safe always :smile:

**Update On the Product as of 5th April, 2016**

I somehow wanted to work things out and started experimenting with this sunscreen. I applied a very tiny amount of the sunscreen mixed with a good moisturizer and voila!! it&#8217;s working :smile: Guess my only mistake was I applied too much of it which my face did not accept :wink: I am happy that the sunscreen is not breaking me out now and getting adjusted to the gel. This sunscreen is kind of becoming my favorite as of now and will definitely keep using it until I find a better sunscreen in store. Thanks for stopping by and hope you like this sunscreen too :smile:
