Heya!!
Who wants to see an ugly pimple scar on the face? Ewwww :stuck_out_tongue: that’s gross. Very lucky few will have a clear and acne free face. But who would not have a pimple in their life? :smile: Everybody will go through a pimple phase in their lifetime and their nasty scars are so bothersome sometimes. My derma suggested a lovely cream from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories called Clearz Plus. It is basically a skin lightening cream which helps get rid of hyperpigmentation, dark spots and blemishes.

Kojic acid – 2% and Vitamin C – 2.5%

Clearz Plus Cream

**My Take On Clearz Plus Cream**

I should say it is an excellent skin lightening cream which I have come across till date. I could see the results from the day one of the application. But it says to apply every morning after cleansing and evening before retiring. I was applying nightly a pea sized amount of this cream every other day. It gives an awesome glow to the face and few days into applying the cream I could notice my acne marks and under eye dark circles reduced to a great extent. I always made sure to apply a good sunscreen whenever I used to step out in the sun after using this cream.

**Pros**

Gives excellent results from the day one of usage.
Gives a nice glow to the face.
Suitable for all skin types
Removes stubborn dark spots and hyperpigmentation.
Little goes a long way. Only a pea sized amount is what is required for the whole face.

**Cons**

I am so happy with the results the cream has given me, I can hardly think of any con.
My Final Verdict:
My my!! I am in awe with this cream and will definitely keep using and buying this until I come across a better cream than this. Priced at Rs.183/- for 15 gms and is available in all leading medical stores. Have a healthy skin and say bye to blemishes and dark spots!! :smile:
