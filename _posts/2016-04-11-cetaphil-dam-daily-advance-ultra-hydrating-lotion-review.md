**My Take On Cetaphil Lotion**

Oh!!! My God, what shall I say about this indeed luxurious lotion? I have a very dry and senstive skin that gets irritated at the drop of the hat. Cetaphil lotion does wonders to my skin. No dry patches whatsoever (Yippee). I mix this lotion with my sunscreen and even apply it in the night in conjunction with other creams to get that soft, supple, smooth and glowing skin. It has the goodness of shea butter and macadamia seed oil which nourishes the skin so well.

**Pros**

The lotion is non-greasy (Tip: use a very little amount of the lotion)
It’s fragrance free which is a boon to sensitive skin
It is non-comedogenic (even oily skinned people can give it a try)
It is paraben free
Gives a healthy glowing skin
Moisturizes the skin very well

**Cons**

I don’t have any con to mention because I am so happy with the lotion. It has given me excellent results :smile:
Priced at Rs. 136.90/- for 30 gms and is available at all leading medical shops in India. Do try this lotion and I am sure you will not be disappointed :smile:
