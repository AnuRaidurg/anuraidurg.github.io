Hello people!! Hope everybody is enjoying the rainy season with a cup of steaming hot chai and pakoras?  Rainy season comes with hordes of diseases too. One such is skin problems. Bacteria throng on our body and lead to many skin problems which might make the skin dull and lifeless. I never use soap for my face and prefer a gentle cleanser instead for my dry sensitive skin. But a friend of mine suggested a soap called Dermadew Lite soap that not only gently cleanses the face but also lightens the skin. So the inquisitive me bought the soap right away as they had an impressive ingredients list. So here is my review on Dermadew Lite Soap by H&amp;H Pharmaceutica.

It has a TFM of 76% which falls under Grade 1 soap category. 

**My Take On Dermadew Lite Soap**

I started using as a regular cleanser every morning. After moistening my face with water I worked out a lather and applied on my face. I left the lather for good 1 minute and washed thereafter. I could notice an instant glow to my face and my skin indeed felt soft and supple. But due to my dry skin my face felt little stretchy after the wash. I followed it up with a good moisturizer and a sunscreen. I used it continuously once daily for a week and felt my skin was becoming very dry due to this soap. So I started using the soap every other day and my skin felt better. Now I use the soap occasionally whenever my skin feels dull and lifeless. And I can see my skin bouncing back to glowing self. May be due to salicylic acid my sensitive skin is not able to tolerate the soap and that’s why I don’t use it everyday. It does not actually whiten the skin but I can say it definitely brightens the skin. May be as they have mentioned if one uses in conjunction with other whitening treatments or medication it might give good results. Otherwise it is a good soap for normal and oily to combination skin. I also suggest not to use these kind of soaps on a daily basis but rather use it rarely. Priced at Rs. 150/- for 75gms is available at medical stores in all major cities.
