Yay!! I am RICH I am RICH :-). Naaaah I haven’t struck gold literally as you are all thinking. But my skin definitely looks rich and radiant after using this cream and I am loving it. Alright I will stop playing around and let you know the cream which I am using. The cream is from Abbott Healthcare called Melaglow Rich. I was using a depigmentation cream earlier and was even happy about the results. But when I ran out of the cream I came across this awesome cream in the med store and decided to give it a try. It is basically a skin brightening and lightening cream used for hyper-pigmentation skin conditions including brown spots.

**My Take On Melaglow Rich:**
I am always unhappy about the under eye dark circles which I have since ages. That’s usually caused by stress or heredity. In my case it may be the latter.
I started using this cream every other day before hitting the bed in the night.  But they recommend to apply twice daily for best results. I did not want to take risk by applying daily due to my sensitive skin. Definitely I had this tingling sensation when I applied this cream on the first day which made me little uncomfortable but disappeared after sometime and I was ok. I did not see any results even after using it for almost a month. May be I was using it sparingly. Then I started using everyday but my skin reacted very badly. My skin became very dry and started to peel. My whole face was burning and I had to slather on moisturizer to cool my skin. I realized my mistake and discontinued using the cream for few days. When my skin got back to normal I started using the cream again every other day as I was using it earlier. This time it was perfect, no dryness or flaking of the skin. At the end of the second month I could see beautiful results.  My under eye dark circles had considerably lightened and my overall skin texture looked great. I am sure using daily would have given me quick results but had to bear the brunt of using it everyday. What I like about the cream is it is made of phytochemicals which is derived from nature(plants) and is absolutely safe to use if you have normal skin. It is strongly recommended to use a sunscreen everyday to achieve better results. Priced at Rs. 348/- the cream is available at all leading medical stores. So grab your Melaglow and become RICH today!! :wink:
