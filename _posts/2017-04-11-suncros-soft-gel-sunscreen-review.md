Hello Summer :smile:

How is everybody doing? I hope all of you are prepping up to protect your skin from the searing heat of summer this time.  I am going to review a sunscreen called Suncros Soft Gel by Sun pharma. I had earlier reviewed a sunscreen from the same pharmaceutical company called suncros aqua gel.

Suncros Soft Gel Sunscreen

**What does the product offer:**

Suncros Soft Gel comes with SPF 50+, is non irritant, water resistant and preservative free.

**Ingredients:**

Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide (micronized), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic acid, Polyhydroxystearic acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.

**Directions:**

Apply liberally on the face, neck and exposed area of the skin atleast 15 minutes before sun exposure. Apply everyday for maximum protection. Suncros Soft sunscreen gel has UVA &amp; UVB filters to provide broad spectrum protection.

**My Take On Suncros Soft Gel:**

The texture of the gel is very soft and is like whipped cream. I applied a very little amount of the gel for my complete face. I knew my face would feel heavy if I applied too much gel. The gel glided just like butter on my face. Luckily my face did not sting after applying the cream which I experienced with their other product. May be that’s because this is a physical sunscreen. My dry skin felt soft, smooth and moisturized because the gel contains vitamin E. It gave a nice matte finish.  I did break out initially due to loads of silicones in it. But got used to it after few days.

**Pros:**

It has a high SPF of 50+ which is very good for the Indian climate. It gave me very good protection from the sun.
It is a physical sunscreen. (Yay!! good for me :smile: )
Little goes a long way (if used properly)
Doesn’t leave any white cast
It is non irritant and preservative free which is a bonus to oily and sensitive skinned people.
It is water resistant. You have to scrub your face to get off the gel :smile: />
Paraben free (Woot woot)
Gives a nice healthy glow to the face.
Works great as a primer, masks the pores really well (thanks to the silicones)

**Cons:**

It is definitely not non-comedogenic. With so much silicones in the sunscreen I would say it is a no no for oily skin.  I feel it clogs the pores if not washed properly. One needs to thoroughly cleanse the face to remove the sunscreen off the face.

**My Final Verdict:**

It will ace as a physical sunscreen sans the silicones given the high sun protection factor but definitely fails as a cream on the whole as it cannot be used by all skin types.  But on the other hand it is too good a sunscreen to let go off as it is a zinc based sunscreen which my skin loves.  That is why I am trying to work things out between us :wink: It is priced at Rs. 545/- for 50gms and is available at medical stores in almost all major cities. So go ahead and be sun safe this summer :smile:
