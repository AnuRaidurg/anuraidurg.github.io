Ahoy lovely people!! :smile: How is the rainy season treating you all? Keep glowing in this rainy season with Glogeous advanced face wash gel from Torrent Pharma. I had tried their AHA Glow earlier and my skin went haywire after using it for few days. It dried my face a lot and I had to stop using it. My friend was using this face wash gel and the inquisitive me wanted to try it.  But I was skeptical to use it as I have very dry skin and because of the terrible experience I had earlier it scared me even more. But I am a very adventurous person :smile: so I went ahead and used this face wash.

**My Take On The Glogeous Face Wash Gel:**

Pros:
* It did not over dry my already very dry skin infact my skin was soft, smooth and glowing after the very first wash.
* It has all natural ingredients which exfoliate, soothe, hydrate and repair damaged skin.
* It is non-comedogenic, sans paraben and SLS which is a boon to sensitive acne prone oily skin.
* It has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which accelerates skin cell turnover which in turn helps in healing acne.
* Can be used by all skin types but dry skinned people should apply generous amount of moisturizer after the wash.
* Little goes a long way.

Cons:
* It can be a little drying on dry skinned people and may break out because of the drying effect.
Price is the concern. It is priced at Rs. 749/- for 100 gms in all medical stores. It is also available online on a discounted price.

**Final Verdict**
I use this face wash when my skin feels very oily and tired and yes it does make a difference to my skin. My skin feels invigorated. But I cannot use this face wash every day as I feel it is bit harsh for my dry skin.  Otherwise it is an excellent cleanser for oily acne prone skin.  So go ahead and get that rosy glowing skin you always wished for :smile:
