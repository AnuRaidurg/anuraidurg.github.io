Shine Bright Like A Diamond :smile:

Oh!! Yes you will if you start applying [Dr. Reddy’s  ReVibra C10](http://revibra.in/), which is the purest topical vitamin C. ReVibra comes in unique packaging of circular dating disc of 28 vegicaps. This helps maintain purity and stability till the last dose. Open the flap of disc, take out a vegicap. Store the disc in a dry place and do not refrigerate the disc or vegicap. Pluck the head of the vegicap to break. Squeeze it in the palm. Apply gently all over the face in circular motions and massage. ReVibra brings vibrancy to the skin and helps maintain youthful look. Unlike any other available vitamin C brands, ReVibra comes in a single dose vegicap that keeps the vitamin stable by protecting from air and light. The vitamin is kept in its purest form making it more effective. Use ReVibra C10 for being vibrant. No preservatives, no colorants and no perfume. Just pure and bioactive vitamin C. Helps in hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Improves procedural outcomes.

**Key benefits/uses of Revibra C10 Pure Vitamin C Cream**

* Cyclopentasiloxane: Majorly used as a conditioner, delivery agent, lubricant, and solvent.
* Dimethicone crosspolymer: Used as a covering and trapping agent.
* Dimethiconol: Used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, and minor skin irritations.

**My Take On Revibra C10 Cream**

Basically my skin is very sensitive and dry. Off late my skin looked dull and lifeless. This may be because of many reasons like pollution, sun damage, physiological variations etc etc., So I thought of giving this little elixir a shot and my skin bounced back like never before. I followed the instructions and applied this wonder cream everyday but it dried my skin. So I used it every other day and it was just fine. I followed it up with a good moisturizer after applying this cream. I woke up with an amazing glow on my face the next morning and I was so happy to look at my face in the mirror. I definitely did not forget to apply my sunscreen when I went out in the morning because vitamin c can cause photo sensitivity.
Available in all medical shops, has a shelf life of one year and priced at Rs. 1526/- (I know its exorbitantly high, but hey no pain no gain isn’t it?). 

**My Final Verdict On Revibra C10 Cream**

It is definitely a big YES and I would repurchase it when I run out of this cream. Though it is priced on the higher side I would prefer re-buying this as it really helped my hyper-pigmented skin get back that glow. So please buy this little wonder and keep glowing :smile:
