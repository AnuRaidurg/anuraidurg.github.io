Hiiiiieeeee beautiful people!!!

Today I will be reviewing fabulous products from Korea. Yes you heard it right from Korea. 
The product’s name is The Face Shop’s Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Skin Care Range. 
I was researching on Phytosphingosine :smile: Yeah such a tough word to pronounce. 
So here is the definition for the same: Phytosphingosine is a conditioning and anti-bacterial lipid. 
It is essential for healthy skin and helps to regulate the production of lipids in the outer skin layers 
thereby promoting natural moisturisation of the skin. So when I googled about this it said beauty products with 
phytosphingosine is very good for dry, sensitive skin and Dr. Belmeur’s topped the list. 
I had heard about Face Shop products but had never used their products. 
I was quick enough to place an order. 
The products I ordered were 
 * Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Foam Cleanser
 * Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Toner 
 * Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Ato Salt Cream.

**My Take On Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Products**

I dread to use any cleanser on my face as my skin is very dry and super sensitive. But somehow gave in to this Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Foam Cleanser as the reviews were good. But it does keep up to its claims to some extent. 

Pros:

* The cleanser did not dry my skin at all. 
* My skin did not feel stretchy after I washed my face. 
* It gives a subtle glow to the face.
* It thoroughly cleansed my face. It removed all the dirt and grime from the face.

Cons:

* It is definitely not for oily skinned people  and hey they have not claimed it either so it is ok.
* At times it can be drying for overly sensitive skinned people like me. 
* It does nothing to help reduce acne or acne scars.

I followed it up with Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Toner after cleansing my face. I do not believe in using a cotton ball to use a toner. I apply the toner with my bare hands directly on my face so that the product soaks into my skin and does the required job. 

Pros:

* My skin felt fresh and smooth after applying the toner. 
* I assume it does not contain alcohol as it did not irritate or dry my skin. 
* My skin felt hydrated for almost 6 hours.
* It brightened my face 
* Toner glides on your skin like a dream and absorbs within seconds. 

I do not have any complaints against this product so no cons and full marks to this toner. 

I thought I will use the Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Ato Salt Cream in the night. The cream has a medium consistency. It spreads easily but feels a little heavy after applying the cream. Though my skin is very dry I felt the cream did not absorb into my skin completely. 

Pros:

* My skin felt moisturized to some extent the next morning.
* Gives a subtle glow to the skin.

Cons:

* It did not moisturize enough my very dry skin. 
* It did not completely absorb into the skin and leaves traces of the product on the skin.

**Final Verdict**

Out of the three products, the Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair cleanser and Toner gets full marks and I might give it a thought of repurchasing, but I was unhappy with the Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Ato Salt Cream’s result and I wouldn’t repurchase the same. If you are ok to pay out on these pricey products, go ahead and buy these products online right away :smile:
