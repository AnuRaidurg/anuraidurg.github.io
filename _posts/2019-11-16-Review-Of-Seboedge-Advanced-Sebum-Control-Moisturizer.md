Heya beautiful!! I am back with yet another review of a moisturizer called SEBOEDGE, an advanced sebum control moisturizer from aurelderma pharmaceuticals. Lately my pores on my cheeks looked enlarged. I was little baffled because I always thought enlarged pores are associated to oily skinned people and not for dry skinned people like me. There are several causes for enlarged pores like high levels of sebum secretion, genetics, or thick hair follicles etc etc,. In my case it might be because of sun damage or over exposure to the sun. Nothing can remove open pores but treatments and products are available that can make them look smaller, giving you the appearance of healthier and more vibrant skin. So my derma prescribed this cream called Seboedge.

**About SEBOEDGE**

Seboedge advanced sebum control moisturizer is a mattifying moisturizing formula which helps to refine skin pores and regulate excess sebum on skin. Biosaccharide gum-1 acts as multifunctional glycan and provides moisturizing, soothing & skin restructuring properties. Oligosaccharides from Lens esculenta extracts smoothes the skin grain & limits shine thus helps in more uniform skin.
You all must be wondering what Lens esculenta extract is? It is nothing but extracts from lentils which is rich in vitamin B5 & trisaccharides to moisturize skin and help increase intracellular hydration, reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It functions as a skin protectant, conditioning agent, and antioxidant.

**Ingredients**

Aqua, Cyclopentasiloxane, Citric Acid, Dimethicone Crosspolymer (&) Dimethicone (&) Laureth-4, Caprylyl Methicone and PEG-1 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Biosaccharide Gum 1, Propanediol, Silica, PPG-1-Trideceth 6, Lens esculenta (Lentil) Seed Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Betaine, Phenoxyehanol and Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance.

**My Take On Seboedge Moisturizer**

I used this moisturizer after cleansing my face. I prefer to use it both at AM & PM because you all know my skin type is dry. The moisturizer is gel based and quickly absorbs into the skin. My skin gulped all the moisturizer in a jiffy. I had to layer up as my skin felt stretchy.

Pros:

* It is paraben free. Yay!! :smile:
* It is gel based which is a bonus to oily type skin.
* Spreads and absorbs easily.
* Can be used as a makeup base or a primer.

Cons:

* It has silicones.
* Donâ€™t know if it is non comedogenic.
* Definitely not for very dry skin types.

**Final Verdict**

I will stay away from this moisturizer at present as it did nothing to blur my pores. It is not moisturizing at all. I will go back to my heavier moisturizers and stick to it as of now. This moisturizer is best suited for oily skinned people. Priced at Rs. 275/- is available at all medical stores. I am sure people who have oily skin will love this moisturizer :smile:
