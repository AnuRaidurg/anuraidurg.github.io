Heya peeps!! How are you all doing? I know the year 2020 is such a disaster with Covid-19 creating havoc around the world, slowly but steadily people are trying to get back to work albeit with lesser employee strength at office and majority of the employees are still working remotely from home and I am one among them. So working from home has its own pros and cons. Iâ€™ve been erratically eating and sleeping :smile: which has taken a toll on my skin. As you all know I have a very dry and sensitive skin and I am always on a look out for this perfect moisturizer which gives me deep hydration.

**About Hyaluronic Acid**

Everyone is raving about Hyaluronic acid (HA) these days and I was intrigued to know more about it. It is a clear substance that is naturally produced by our body. So when it comes to skin plumping and hydrating, this powerful humectant should be a go-to ingredient. It helps in alleviating dry skin, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and speeds up wound healing. It is safe to use even during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It works well and poses no threat to the mom or the baby. So when I was searching for a good HA cream online, I found this amazing hyaluronic acid gel called hyaluGEL from Ethicare Remedies. Initially I was skeptical to buy this gel because it has parabens in it but later I gave in for the fact that studies show parabens are not proved to be dangerous or harmful (Just a reason to use this cream :smile:).

**Key Ingredients**

Aqua, Glycerine, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%), DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Methylparaben, Sodium Propylparaben, Carbomer.

**What The Product Claims**

It is non sticky, non-oily, non comedogenic, hypo allergenic, fragrance free, colour free, aqueous gel.

**My Take On hyaluGEL**

I read that there is a proper way of applying hyaluronic acid creams or gels. To get the maximum benefit of hyaluronic acid, it is best to use it in conjunction with your existing moisturizer to seal in the moisture. People with dry/sensitive skin can look for either water or oil based HA creams and oily/combination skinned people can go for water based HA products. To start with I applied the gel every other day and only in the night on the damp skin and topped it with my regular moisturizer. Never apply HA products on very dry skin as it makes the skin even drier. I could see an immediate effect on my skin. My skin felt hydrated and soft. My pores literally became invisible. I woke up to a plumper and more refreshed looking face.

Thumbs :+1:

* The gel soothes, makes the skin smooth, soft and supple
* It repairs and replenishes damaged skin caused by acne
* It reduces pigmentation and acne scars
* It shrinks the pores to some extent
* Brightens the skin and leaves a subtle glow
* Can be used as a primer or base
* Spreads and absorbs easily onto the skin

Thumbs :-1:

* It might irritate sensitive skin so I would recommend a patch test before starting any HA creams/gels.
* It is not paraben free 
* Price is on the higher side

**Final Verdict**

I would definitely re-purchase it and include in my skin care regime as my skin benefitted from the gel. Priced at Rs. 250/- for 30g, this gel can be purchased online. So go for it guys and gals as everyone can use this gel.
