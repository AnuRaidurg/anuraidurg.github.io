Hello all you lovely people!! Rise and shine :smile: October is here and no wonder its called the second summer as the sun will be up in full force during this month. As always I do not step out of the house without applying sunscreen all through the year and this time around I wanted to try a new sunscreen. No offence but I was thinking if the commercial/cosmetic brands are as effective as the pharmaceutical products?

So to test I bought sunscreen from Lotus Organics+ mineral sunscreen which claims to have 100% certified organic actives. It comes in three variants with SPF 30, 40 and 50. To try with I bought Lotus organics+ Hydrating Gel Mineral Sunscreen with SPF 30++. The brand promises to be free from sulphates, parabens, preservatives, synthetic fragrance and petroleum. It is cruelty free as well. It has the goodness of natural oils, bio active naturals and  organic butters. This Hydrating Gel Mineral Sunscreen is a high performing  gel based formulation that stands up to the most intense outdoor  activities and protects from harmful UVA/UVB rays. Certified organic frangipani extract gives a mesmerising soothing effect on skin.

**My Take On Lotus Organics+ Hydrating Gel Mineral Sunscreen**

The product says the organics+ ritual is to be initiated  every morning by cleansing your face by our Divine Nourish Face Wash. After this, apply Hydrating Gel Mineral Sunscreen evenly on face and exposed body parts before exposure to sun. Reapply frequently. I chose SPF 30 sunscreen as it said its an hydrating gel. I have a dry skin and wanted to see if it really hydrates my skin. I was out in the sun for an hour and it definitely did it's job. It did not burn or tan my skin.

Thumbs :+1:

* Sunscreen is lightweight gel based formula. Best suited for oily skinned people like my husband :wink:
* Has a very smooth texture which glides onto the skin
* Does not clog pores
* It is non greasy and absorbs quickly
* Gives a bright and naturally radiant look
* It is a chemical free sunscreen

Thumbs :-1:

* Leaves a white cast
* Did not hydrate or moisture my skin that well. My skin felt dry as I had skipped applying moisturiser.

**Final Verdict**

I would recommend this sunscreen as it is a mineral sunscreen and free of chemicals. It scored big in terms of protecting my skin from harmful sun rays. But you may have to reapply every 2 hours to get the at-most benefit from this sunscreen. Priced at Rs. 495/- for 100gm, it is worth every penny. So grab this sunscreen and go au naturel :smile: :smile:
