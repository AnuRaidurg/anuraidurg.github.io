Hello my lovely people. Hope this year is treating everyone good as most of us have been vaccinated and trying to keep safe from the deadly pandemic. I know my review came in after a haul as I have been super busy with my little monster who keeps me on my toes :smile: Okay so I am going to review two sunscreens from the same pharmaceutical brand Cipla. It is Rivela Tint and Rivela Lite. Both sunscreens are tinted and has SPF 50.

# Rivela Tint

Rivela Tint sunscreen with SPF 50 provides broad spectrum protection against UVA (skin ageing) and UVB (burning) rays. It is formulated with liquid crystal technology for velvety touch and non sticky feel. Rivela Tint with a light brown shade gives a natural look.

Long list of ingredients :smile:

**My Take On Rivela Tint Sunscreen**

I applied the sunscreen before stepping out of the house as per the directions for use written on the product. It is slightly tinted and consistency is of a lotion. I was attracted with the words Liquid Crystal Technology used in the product. Wherein the skin cells are held together by the intercellular matrix (the mortar), which helps prevent moisture loss and creates the smooth appearance on the surface (Phew! :smile:)

Thumbs :+1:

* It is paraben free and water resistant
* It is slightly tinted and can be used as a makeup base.
* It has vitamin E which is good for dry skin to keep it moisturised.
* No white cast.

Thumbs :-1:

* It is definitely not non sticky as the product claims.
* Though I have a very dry skin, my skin became very oily right after applying the sunscreen. So I do not recommend this product for oily skinned people.
* Though I did not break out, I assume the product is comedogenic. I did not see non-comedogenic mentioned on the product.
* It contains oxybenzone

# Rivela Lite

Rivela Lite sunscreen with SPF 50 provides broad spectrum sun protection against UVA (skin ageing) and UVB (burning) rays. Rivela Lite with a light brown shade gives a natural look.

**My Take On Rivela Tint Sunscreen**

Again I applied the sunscreen as per the directions for use written on the product. It is slightly tinted and has a mousse texture. I This time I was drawn towards the words Weightless Mousse. Wherein the sunscreen is light and gentle on the skin. It should also glide seamlessly on the skin giving a matte finish without looking cakey.

Thumbs :+1:

* It is water resistant.
* I did not see paraben listed in the ingredients. So I assume it is paraben free as well.
* No white cast.
* Oily skinned people might like this because it is very light on the skin and not oily.
* I did not break out.

Thumbs :-1:

* My dry skin hated it as the sunscreen did not spread well though I had applied moisturiser.
* It stings and burns (this could just be on my skin).
* It contains oxybenzone
* Very expensive.

**Final Verdict On Rivela Tint And Rivela Lite**

I always prefer physical over chemical sunscreens. But after reading rave reviews about the product I wanted to try both the sunscreens. But it came as a disaster as I suffered hyperpigmentation and burning sensation after applying the sunscreens. After much research I found out that two things can cause hyperpigmentation: skin-stressful physical effects and hormonal effects. Sunscreen will cause hyperpigmentation if it has any one of these effects **If the sunscreen you wear stresses your skin (some chemical sunscreens can do this), it may cause skin darkening.** Secondly, if you use sunscreen that has hormonally-active ingredients (like oxybenzone), it can cause hormonal skin darkening. So in my case the culprit was oxybenzone. So I immediately stopped using the sunscreens and my skin took a lot of time to recover.

Rivela Tint is priced at Rs. 563/- for 50ml and Rivela Lite is priced at Rs. 970/- for 60gms. It is available in all the medical stores and online as well.

I suggest everyone to choose the best sunscreen according to skin type and needs. I will be back with another review soon. Till then stay safe, healthy and keep glowing :smile:
