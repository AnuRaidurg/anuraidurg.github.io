Helloooo beautiful people. What is my story today?? Here I am with yet another review of a product which I really wanted to post from a long time. It is USV pharmaceuticals Golite cream. It is a de-pigmentation and skin lightening cream. Excited?? Ok let’s not waste time and get started with the review.

Key benefits of Golite skin lightening cream

- It scavenges free radicals which are a major cause of hyperpigmentation.
- It inhibits tyrosinase activity which leads to the synthesis of melanin.
- It protects the skin from UV damage and radiation.
- Safe for long term use.
- Good for sensitive skin as well.


Thumbs :+1:

I don’t believe in skin lightening creams. As I always say no creams or lotions can lighten the natural skin tone. Before I started applying this cream, I mapped my skin tone from the skin tone shade card provided in the carton box. So basically I started using this cream to lighten my under eye dark circles and few acne scars.
 
* It does not have that oily sticky feeling when you apply this cream. It glides easily onto the skin and gives a fresh glow to the face.
* It does not contain steroids.
* It is phthalates and paraben free :smile:


Thumbs :-1:

* I did not find any changes in my skin tone or my dark circles or the acne scars did not fade whatsoever.
* It said the cream generally won’t cause any side effects. But I experienced a reaction to the cream and developed small bumps on my face. Probably I was allergic to some ingredient in the cream.
