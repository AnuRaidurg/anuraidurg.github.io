A Very Happy New Year Everyone!! Winter woes are back again :disappointed: Though it is not very cold this time compared to last winter my skin is not behaving good this year. I have this persistent bad guy (read eczema) who is stalking and does not want to let go of me.

If I slather moisturizer I breakout and if I apply less I breakout :disappointed: So I was looking for a moisturizer which can regulate and control sebum production and viola I found one!

**Acne-OC Sebum Regulating Moisturizer**

I am super excited to review a fabulous cream by IPCA pharmaceuticals called ACNE-OC sebum regulating moisturizer. This cream is entirely my discovery (Google) and no dermatologist prescribed it to me.


*Key highlights*

Acne-OC sebum regulating moisturizer comes with natural phyto active complex. Its pore minimizing, sebo-regulator, non-glossy, non-irritant and non-comedogenic.

Thumbs :+1:

* This comes in a gel formula and is so lightweight that it feels like a feather when I apply this moisturizer.
* It is non greasy, paraben, alcohol, PABA, dye free and without colour additives :clap:
* It is specially designed for sensitive acne prone skin. Oily skinned people can dance :smile:
* I thought it will not hydrate my very dry skin as its in gel formula and for oily skinned people. But to my surprise my skin felt so moisturized and hydrated.
* Requires a teeny-weeny amount of cream and the moisturizer lasts forever.


Thumbs :-1:

* Thinkinggggg :thinking:

**Final Verdict**

This is the acme moisturizer for my skin right now. By the way my eczema looks much better after applying this moisturizer. Priced at Rs. 560/- for 75gm. It is easily available in all the medical stores and online pharmacies. I am sure everyone will definitely be very happy after using this moisturizer.

See you all soon :smile:
