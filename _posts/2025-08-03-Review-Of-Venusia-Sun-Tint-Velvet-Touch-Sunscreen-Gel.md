Yay!! I am 115+ covered :smile: hehehe surprised? Hello my lovely people!! We are almost mid way through the year and witnessed scorching summer. So my hunt for a good sunscreen never ends.

As we have to be sun protected round the year. While I was browsing through the net I found this sunscreen from Dr. Reddy’s, 

**Venusia Sun Tint.**

I was amazed to see that the sunscreen has 115+ SPF. I was definitely intrigued to try this sunscreen with such high SPF. It has some interesting ingredients as well. It has tomato extract, jojoba seed oil and squalane.

Thumbs :-1:

* Dry skinned people might find it difficult to spread the sunscreen evenly. Solution is to apply a thin layer of moisturiser underneath the sunscreen. 
* If you apply too much sunscreen it might leave a white/grey cast.
